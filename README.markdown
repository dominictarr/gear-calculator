# gear-calculator

I wrote this a few years ago, to calculate gear ratios for a lathe.

The lathe was imperial, but I wanted to cut metric threads!
The lathe had a bunch of gears, and a table for how to arrange
the gears to get metric -- only some of the needed gears where missing.

Is is possible to make metric ratios with the gears we had?
I wrote this litte Java (!) program to find out.
